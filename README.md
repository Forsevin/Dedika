Dedika
======

More content and applications are being developed for the web using HTML5 technology, while it make everything easy 
accessible it does give some limitation and problems, like that everything (usually) are being runned from the same process or program
causing everything to crash at once, additional GUI even for application you decide to drag from the main window etc.

Dedika allows you to run web application just like any other application simply by embeding a browser into a window. 
Application can be defined through XML.

A small application "store" and javascript API are being developed.
